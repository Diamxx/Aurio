1. Download required FFmpeg files from https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/

   Currently used: FFmpeg 3.3.3
   ----------------------------

2. Download "win32" and "win64" "shared" and "dev" packages
   (7-zip is required to extract them: http://www.7-zip.org/download.html)

3a. Automatically setup FFmpeg directory structure by placing downloaded files into this file's directory, calling "ffmpeg-extract.bat" and following instructions

   -- OR --

3b. Manually extract and place contents of shared and dev archives (without root folder) in win32 or win64 subfolder

4. The final folder structure should look like this:

   .(this folder)
   |
   |-- win32
   |   |--bin (containing dlls)
   |   |--include (containing headers in subdirectories)
   |   |--lib (containing libs)
   |
   |-- win64
       |... same as above
